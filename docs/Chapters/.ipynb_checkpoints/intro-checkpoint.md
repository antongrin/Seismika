# Seismika

Seismika is a set of Python-based scripts and explanations of some basic concepts related to seismic exploration.

## Author

My name is Anton Grinevskiy, I am a geoscientist working in a seismic interpretation team. I also assist in teaching a course on seismic imaging at the university.

## Motivation

Over several past years, Python helped me to solve a lot of work tasks. I also found it very convenient tool to illustrate some concepts and phenomena.

Sometimes you try to understand how an algorithm works, but an equation in a textbook or a commercial software is not enough. I hope that here you may find some useful insights into seismic processing and interpretation procedures. This so-called 'book' does not claim to be exhaustive or complete; this is just a set of notebooks that I managed to make presentable enough.
